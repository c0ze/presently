a chrome app which shows weather forecast
shamelessly picked up from [here](http://www.ng-newsletter.com/posts/chrome-apps-on-angular.html)
you need coffeescript and slimrb to build.
for the weather forecast, you need to signup with [weather underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) and enter your api key in .env as API_KEY.
